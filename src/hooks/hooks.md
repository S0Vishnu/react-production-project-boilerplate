# `hooks/` Folder

This folder contains custom React hooks that encapsulate reusable logic for React components. Hooks simplify state management, side effects, or shared logic.

## Folder Structure
```

hooks/
├── useCustomHookA.ts # Hook A: Description
├── useCustomHookB.ts # Hook B: Description
└── ...

````

## Usage
Import hooks into your components as needed:
```typescript
import { useCustomHookA } from '../hooks/useCustomHookA';

const { value, setValue } = useCustomHookA(initialValue);
````

## Examples

- **useFetchData.ts**: Handles data fetching logic.
- **useToggle.ts**: Provides a simple toggle state.

## Best Practices

- Keep hooks focused on one responsibility.
- Avoid side effects unless explicitly required.
- Test each hook in isolation.
