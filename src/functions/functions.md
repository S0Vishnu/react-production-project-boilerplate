# `functions/` Folder

This folder contains reusable, non-React utility functions that can be used across the application. These functions are designed to handle pure logic or data manipulation without interacting with React components.

## Folder Structure
```

functions/
├── fileA.ts # Function A: Handles X
├── fileB.ts # Function B: Performs Y
└── ...

````

## Usage
Import functions into your components, services, or other files as needed:
```typescript
import { functionA } from '../functions/fileA';

const result = functionA(input);
````

## Examples

- **FileA**: Utility for formatting dates.
- **FileB**: Helper for generating unique IDs.

## Best Practices

- Ensure each function is modular and testable.
- Write unit tests for every utility function in the `tests/unit/` folder.
