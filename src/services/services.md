# `services/` Folder

This folder handles API requests and encapsulates business logic, ensuring separation of concerns.

## Folder Structure
```

services/
├── apiService.ts # Generic API service
├── userService.ts # User-specific API logic
└── ...

````

## Usage
Use services in components, hooks, or store actions:
```typescript
import { fetchUser } from '../services/userService';

const data = await fetchUser(userId);
````

## Examples

- **apiService.ts**: Handles HTTP requests (GET, POST, etc.) using Axios or Fetch.
- **userService.ts**: Provides functions for user-specific APIs, such as login or profile updates.

## Best Practices

- Keep services focused on one area of functionality.
- Avoid directly using services in components; prefer hooks or actions.
- Add error handling and retry logic as necessary.
